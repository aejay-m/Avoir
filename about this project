Hi there!, 

AVOIR is a visitor pass management system school project that generates a record of a visitor that can enable to
keep track of exact times of a visitor sign in and out of in the premises. Visitor information is 
stored in a computer database, allowing reports of visitor activity to be quickly created and secured.
After adding a visior the system will print a visitor badge.

Instead using of a logbook, this system will efficiently, effectively welcome a visitor and will create secure facility for all students and 
employees.This system is made by Java using Eclipse IDE. All operations of the database is done by Maria 
DB and MYSQL Workbench
